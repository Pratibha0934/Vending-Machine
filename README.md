# Vending Machine
The project involves designing and implementing a digital system for a vending machine using Verilog. A vending machine dispenses a product to the users based on the amount of money inserted and selection of the product. I have assumed that in my world there exists only Rs.5 and Rs.10 coins and the vending machine produces an item of cost Rs.15.
On this basis I have designed the Mealy Machine State Diagram (comprising of three states S0, S1 and S2).
Thus the project involves designing the logic, specifying inputs and outputs, designing the state machine, and creating control logic. Hence simulating and testing the vending by creating a test bench to ensure it functions correctly.
